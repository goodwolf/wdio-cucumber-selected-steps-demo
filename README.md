# Description

This is the demo project for the [wdio-cucumber-selected-steps](https://github.com/jambit/wdio-cucumber-selected-steps) library, which ships a set of common steps for writing cucumber feature files for use with webdriver.io.

This demo-project is (like the library itself) also based on the official [boilerplate](https://github.com/webdriverio/cucumber-boilerplate), but has been rewritten to use the above project and also fix some errors.

Official repository: https://github.com/jambit/wdio-cucumber-selected-steps-demo
